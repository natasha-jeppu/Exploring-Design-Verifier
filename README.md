# Exploring-Design-Verifier
A set of Simulink blocks to explore Design Verifier in Flight Controls.

This is a collection of Simulink models which can be used to explore Simulink Design Verifier. The blocks are commonly used in flight control laws. The verification utilities of SDV prove the correctness of implementation. The requirements for the blocks is given as a PDF file. Some of the blocks have mutations introduced to show the working of SDV.
